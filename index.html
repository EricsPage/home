<h1>Eric's Project Website</h1>
<h2>This website is intended to show off some of the projects that I have done. It is a work in progress and will likely chage and be updated over time.</h2>

<h3>Surface Conductivity Simulations</h3>
<p>
I simulated the effect finite-sized contacts have for materials with different surface and bulk conductivities. 
I discovered that smaller probes appear to have a three order magnitude delay in the effect that the bulk resistance has on the equivilent resistance.
I made a poster of my results and presented it at the APS March Meeting 2024.

<h3>Vacuum Chamber Window</h3>
<p>
Made small window (or port hole) for the vacuum chamber at Zeus. I was supposed to make a stand for the cameras aswell but an undergrad beat me to it.

<h3>Circ du Heart</h3>
<p>
This is a cute Valentine's Day gift I made for my significant other. It uses a 555 timer in astable mode to make a bunch of LED's blink.
It uses large pull-down resistors to reduce unnecessary power-loss.
Only 3 LED's are capable of being powered in series, so we need 5 branches to light up all 14.

<h3>The Analog Tea Tester</h3>
<p>
I can't stand to drink things that are too hot! This is a problem becuase I really like tea.
Often in my zealous moment of thirst I end up accidentially getting a huge mouthful of burning tea.
I hate buring myself, so to fix the problem I made a little temperature circuit. It will light up when the tea
is below some temperature (set by the potentiometer). It is powered by some vape battery I found on the ground after a 
noisy party my neighbors had. The components are comepletely passive and not very resource intensive. I bet this
could be implmented into a silicone tea infuser. Idk maybe I'll look into patenting it later.

<h3>Portal Cap</h3>
<p>
I put an infinity mirror on my graduation cap. What I did was place 8 LED's between a mirror and a one-way mirror.
When light hits the one-way mirror, half gets reflected back and half goes through. The light that gets reflected back 
will reflect off the mirror on the bottom, and come back up. This makes some of the light travel a farther distance, 
creating the illusion of seemingly no bottom.
I powered the cap with two 3.3v LiPo's I found in some littered vape cartridges.

<h3>Flying Wing: Paaka</h3>
<p>
Designed a flying wing in solidworks whose wings could be cut out of a single sheet of 20x30 DollarTree foam board.
It flew okay but was only able to stay in the air for ~10 minutes.
Note: the design dock is in mm.

<h3>3D Printed Airplane</h3>
<p>
I decided to model an RC plane in Sieme's NX and print it. The wings were made out of foam an laminated with heatshrink. 
Power system was a 3S lipo and a 1100kv motor.
The plane had TERRIBLE aerodynamics. I did get it to land tail-first in the snow once though.

<h3>Really Really Dumb DAC</h3>
<p>
This is a really dumb digital to analog converter I made as a joke. It does work. The PWM period actually maps onto the resistance sweep linearly if you can believe it.
Requires 5v and 1A to supply power to the servo.
